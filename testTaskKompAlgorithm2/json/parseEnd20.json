So you can play\nanyway you want, just be cool and have fun. In case\nyou do want some suggestions, they are included\nbelow.\n\nScoring Points:\n\nA beanbag landing on the target scores points,\nif and only if, the black dot on the beanbag is completely within\na numbered colored area on the target below. Once a beanbag\nlands on a target, the points that the beanbag earns cannot be\nchanged by having another beanbag hit and move it.\n\nTossing Order:\n\nIn all games, players alternate throwing one of\ntheir beanbags at the target. In the first game, the younger\nplayer makes the first toss to start the game. In subsequent\ngames, the losing team would make the first toss. When both\nplayers have thrown their 3 beanbags, it counts as a round. After a round, the player with the lower score starts the next round. If a beanbag lands in \u201cBummer (lose your turn)\u201d a player does not throw a beanbag the next time it is their turn and would only throw 2\nbeanbags in a round.\n\nTossing Position:\n\nWe recommend putting a mark down on the floor about 4 feet from the target and requiring players to toss from\nbehind that line. The distance can be adjusted based on the ability of the players. For players of different abilities, the toss line\ndistance can be varied between the two players to try to give the lesser player an advantage.\n\nRace to 60 Game:\n\nThe player to score a total of exactly 60 points wins the game! If a player lands on a number that would have\ntheir total go over 60, then they subtract that number from their score! For example, if a player were at 50 points and their next\nbeanbag toss scores 25 points, then their new total would be 25 (50-25).\n\nRace to 70 Game:\n\nSame as above, players just need to score 70 points. Players can actually agree prior to the start of the game to\nrace to any number, we recommend 60 and 70 to stay in the theme of the game and to create quick games.\n\nDouble and Triple Score Race:\n Players pick a point total to race to, we recommend 225 as a starting point. In this game, if a player\nscores two of a same point value during a round, they double the points for the matching values. If they score 3 of the same value\nduring a round, they triple the value of their points! Players still have to reach the desired point total exactly to win and if they go over, they still subtract the value of their last toss including double or triple score values.\n\n5 to 25:\n\nThe first player to score at least one 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 point toss, wins! Players are allowed to score more than one of any\npoint value, with no penalty.\n\nWinner Takes All!\n\nFor this game players will use poker chips (like our GA2048) or coins (like pennies). Each player starts with an\nequal number of chips or coins (try starting with 7 each the first time you play and adjust as you go). Players stand behind the starting line and toss a chip onto the target. Players score points for a chip or coin that lands completely within an area with a point total.\nThe player with the highest point value wins all the chips. If two or more players score the same point total, those players throw\nanother chip until one player wins. The winning player wins all the chips tossed since the end of the previous round including all\nthose that did not stay on the mat. For a faster game, players can spread out an equal distance from the target and all toss at once, just make sure you know who tossed which chip or coin! Once a player runs out of chips, they are out of the game. Play continues until\r\none player wins all the chips.\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Details\nCustomer Reviews\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur funkified retro beanbag game proves that fun never goes out of style!
