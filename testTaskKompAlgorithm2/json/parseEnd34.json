The games are handcrafted from 100% wood as they do not include any composite materials or plastics. The 4\u2019 x 2\u2019 size is made to ACA regulations. The top surface is 1\/2\u201d varnished cabinet-grade plywood (ACA regulation), which provides the perfect amount of slide. Both sizes are made using handcrafted pine wood frames, featuring mitered corner joints. The wooden legs are retractable and are held in place by robust 3\/8\u201d galvanized steel bolts with wing nuts. Also included are 8 regulation size all-weather CornHole Bags which measure 6\u201d x 6\u201d and weigh 1 pound each. These bags are filled with recycled plastic pellets, but unlike corn, they will not rot if they get wet. Overall this is a well-built Cornhole set for Cornhole enthusiast. Portable set weighs about 38 pounds. \n\n\n\nRelated Categories:\n\nSports & PE : Lawn Games : Beanbag TossGames : Lawn & Toss GamesSports & PE : Field Day : Field Day GamesSports & PE : Lawn Games : Outdoor Games \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Description Details \n\n\n Quantity Per Pack\n1"}
